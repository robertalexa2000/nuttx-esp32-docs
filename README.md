# NuttX ESP32 Docs

The purpose of this repository is to provide documents (tutorials, board schematics etc) to the NuttX community for running on ESP32. The tutorials are step by step and provide the basis for anyone who wishes to make their first steps in the IoT area using NuttX and ESP32.

Some of the resources presented here are centered around the Faculty of Computer Science at Politehnica University of Bucharest, such as the Linux VM used or the board schematic for ESP32-Sparrow (which is not available on market).
